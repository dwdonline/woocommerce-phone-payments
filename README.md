woocommerce-phone-payments
=======================

Adds the ability to add payments to Woocommerce orders from the order admin screen.

#How It Works

Woocommerce doesn't offer a way to add payments to manually created orders other than e-mailing an invoice to the customer.

This plugin basically opens a checkout window for the current order so you can add payments using any installed and active payment gateway.

#Usage

* Activate the plugin
* Create a new order, add line items, calculate total, and save.
* Click add payment, checkout, close the window, and reload.
